            Ruby on Rails engineer seeking developer position where I can make a difference in my work for the world, and to further my knowledge in all languages of code. I have grown up in Charleston and was brought up to be a gentleman. My Food, Beverage, and Hospitality experiance brings a unique aspect to me. I have worked on all echelons of the business. I have served drinks to celebrities and poured wine for politicians. To serving beer to blue collar workers and dealing with high volume turnover. I manage myself very well, I can manage many processes and needs in my mind, making sure that these are fulfilled and done with a smile and to make these people happy that they came to see me. I have found that this helps me in life by being able to work with anyone, and also communicate to all levels of people with comfort, which not many people find easy to do.
